## Lake Malombe Study
In this study, we estimated the trophic status of Lake Malombe in Malawi-a lake likely to be
affected by eutrophication and algal bloom. We integrated in situ data with the Sentinel-2 MSI algorithmâ€”an algorithm with two bands at the central wavelength of 665 nm or 705 nm and relatively narrow spectral bandwidth (31 nm or 15/16 nm), which corresponds to a strong absorption feature in the red and reflectance peak of chl-a (Page et al. 2018) to estimate spatial and temporal dynamics of chl-a in Lake Malombe.
