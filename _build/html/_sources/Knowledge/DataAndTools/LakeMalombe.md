# Lake Malombe Study

## Figure 2: NDCI-calibration–validation-lake-Malombe.
(a) calibration (N = 10) and (b) validation (N = 19); the chl-a concentration in the east point for July was not available due to cloud coverage). The calibration curve was: $Cℎl-a = 431.98 NDCI^2 + 9.547 NDCI + 104$ ($R^2$ = 0.54). Based on the NDCI algorithms for Lake Malombe, predicted chl-a concentrations were estimated; the RMSE for the validation datasets was 2.88 $mg/m^3$. The dashed line represents the 1:1 line.

The established NDCI algorithm was applied to all of the pixels corresponding to the water area, which was delineated using a technique proposed by Donchyts et al. (2016). Python libraries including geemap and cartopy were used for image productions. Images available during a specific month were composited, and mean Chl-a values were calculated for all of the water area pixels. Lighter green colors indicate a higher Chl-a concentration, while darker green colors indicate a lower Chl-a concentration. A color map barrage from 0 to 20 $mg/m^3$

to October 31, 2019. The solid lines indicate satellite-derived data, while circle plots do measured data

(middle), and precipitation data (bottom), covering the entire year starting from January to December in 2019. The central point of the lake (14.642°S, 35.257°E) and a location near the west shoreline (14.643°S, 35.163°E) were selected as monitoring points for MODIS imagery. Two dashed lines indicate the EOS and SOS, respectively.
